# FlexiContracts: A Novel and Efficient Scheme for Upgrading Smart Contracts in Ethereum Blockchain

## Overview
FlexiContracts extends the official Go Ethereum implementation to enhance the upgradability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By integrating a sophisticated automated storage reorganization mechanism and an on-chain governance protocol, FlexiContracts offers an efficient solution for managing smart contract upgrades without sacrificing security or integrity.

## Features
### Automated Storage Reorganization

FlexiContracts introduces a dynamic storage reorganization mechanism that automatically adjusts the storage layout of smart contracts as they are upgraded. This feature detects changes in contract definitions and reorganizes storage variables to minimize disruption and ensure data consistency. By doing so, it preserves the state across contract versions, preventing data loss and reducing the complexity typically associated with contract upgrades.

### On-chain Governance Protocol

At the core of FlexiContracts is an on-chain governance protocol that empowers stakeholders to participate actively in the upgrade process. This protocol allows contract users and stakeholders to propose changes, deliberate on potential upgrades, and vote using a transparent and secure system. The governance mechanism is designed to ensure that all upgrades are in the best interest of the community, fostering a collaborative environment for continuous improvement.

## Prerequisites

Before installing FlexiContracts, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **Go 1.18 or later**: FlexiContracts requires Go version 1.18 or higher. You can download the latest version from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
- **A C compiler**: A C compiler is needed for building dependencies. GCC or Clang are recommended, and they can typically be installed through your system's package manager.

These tools are essential for building and running the modified go-ethereum source code that powers FlexiContracts.
